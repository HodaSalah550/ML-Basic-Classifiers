# Machine Learning Classification Techniques
## Applying diffirent ways for classifying the same undefined pattern for the same 3 classes each class with 10 samples, then comparing the results in each technique
## The codes uses 3 classes, each class has 10 samples.
### 1. Bayes -For the Normally Distributed Classes- : 1.1 Univariate (1D vector) 1.2 Multivariate (2D or more) 
#### By using  an equation after calculating mean, variance, and covariance.

### 2. Nearest Neighbour: 2.1 Single Nearest Neighbour 2.2 K-Nearest Neighbour
#### By calculating distance between the unkown value and each sample then determine wich class is the closest.

### 3. Adaptive Decision Boundary:
