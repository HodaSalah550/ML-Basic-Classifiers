# Bayes Classifier
## For the NormalDistributed Classes
##Two types: 1. Univariate 2. Multivariate 
### 1. Univariate: for single feature vector
### 2. Multivariate: for more than one feature vector
##### The codes uses 3 classes, each class has 10 samples
##### by giving undefined pattern we can classify by using the calculations of mean and variance
