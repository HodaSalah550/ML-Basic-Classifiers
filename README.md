# ML-Bayes-Classifier-Normal-Distribution-Single-Feature-Vector
### Simple Classifier for Normal Distributions with Single Feature Vector using Machine Learning
##### Using 3 classes, each class has 10 feature vector values
##### by giveing undefined pattern we can classify
##### using the calculations of mean and variance
